# Hepha Hub

Hephahub is a centralized hub designed to collect and distribute instructions and metadata (termed as "hephabooks") from and to AI models. The core aim of this hub is to enable AI models to interact more effectively and efficiently with the cyber world by leveraging the power of knowledge, thereby enhancing their ability to complete various tasks.

Inspired by [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) marks an evolution from simply chatting with large language models (LLMs) to leveraging them in more advanced ways. This includes prompting, tools offering, and orchestrating tasks to accomplish real-world objectives. 

Hephahub expands upon this premise. Each successful execution of an AI task can be recorded and collected, including details such as the AI model employed, runtime parameters of the model, prompts used, tasks carried out, tools utilized in the tasks, sequence of tasks, and so on. Each of these comprehensive compilations forms a 'Hephabook'.

These Hephabooks can be downloaded and reused by other AI models, fostering a culture of knowledge sharing and collaborative learning. The reuse and repurposing of these Hephabooks not only bolster productivity but also minimize unnecessary repetition, thereby conserving our environmental resources.

In this ecosystem, an LLM serves as a domain expert, instructing peripheral systems, devices, and tools to complete tasks using the domain knowledge it possesses or acquires over time.

With Hephahub, we aim to revolutionize the way AI models interact with the world, empowering them to instruct and collaborate with other systems, devices, and tools to accomplish real-world tasks. Join us in this journey to unlock the full potential of AI!
